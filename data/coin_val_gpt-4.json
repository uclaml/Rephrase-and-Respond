Indhira, a person who might potentially interfere with its state, has abstained from doing so - more specifically, she did not flip it. This playfully implies that her lack of action has left the coin in the same state. Likewise, another person by the name of Ragavan also refrained from flipping the coin which means he too did not alter the coin's condition.
