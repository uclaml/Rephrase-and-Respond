{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cZack Greinke pitched a complete game\u201d", "answer": "Yes", "response": "Is it conceivable that Zack Greinke could have pitched an entire game on his own? \n\nYes, it is possible. In baseball, a pitcher such as Zack Greinke could conceivably pitch a complete game, which means he would be the only pitcher for his team for the entire duration of the game. This typically occurs over nine innings in a standard game, but could also be over fewer innings in a shorter game."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cJakub Vrana hit a walkoff homer\u201d", "answer": "No", "response": "\"Is it possible that Jakub Vrana hit a game-ending, or 'walkoff', home run?\" \n\nNo, it is not plausible because Jakub Vrana is a professional ice hockey player, not a baseball player. The term \"walkoff homer\" is specific to baseball."}

Michael Conforto is a professional baseball player, known for playing for the New York Mets in the Major League Baseball (MLB). A three-second violation is a rule in basketball, not baseball, making it impossible for him to commit such a violation."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cJavier Zanetti earned a direct kick\u201d", "answer": "Yes", "response": "\"Is it plausible or possible that Javier Zanetti received a direct kick during a soccer game?\" Yes, it is plausible."}

{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cCollin Sexton took a throw in\u201d", "answer": "No", "response": "\"Is it plausible that Collin Sexton was the one who executed a throw-in?\" \n\nThis statement is implausible or unlikely as Collin Sexton is a professional basketball player and the term \"throw in\" is generally used in soccer or football. Unless Sexton was participating in a charity football match or casually playing a different sport, it would be rare for him to take a throw-in. So, the answer is No."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cSean Couturier passed the puck in the Stanley Cup\u201d", "answer": "Yes", "response": "Is it believable or possible that Sean Couturier passed the puck during a game in the Stanley Cup tournament?\n\nYes, it is plausible as Sean Couturier is a professional ice hockey player who could potentially participate in the Stanley Cup."}

Miller is involved in a sport such as baseball where throwing a ball to first base is a common action, then yes, it would be plausible."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cKeenan Allen drew a flag on the play in the NFC championship\u201d", "answer": "Yes", "response": "\"Is it believable or likely that Keenan Allen was involved in a play in the NFC championship where he caused a penalty and a flag was thrown?\" \n\nYes, it's plausible as Keenan Allen is a professional football player and it is common part of games for flags to be thrown due to penalties."}

{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cJack Eichel dunked the ball\u201d", "answer": "No", "response": "Is it possible or likely that Jack Eichel slammed a basketball through a hoop, also known as dunking?\n\nThe plausibility of this sentence is dependent on context. If Jack Eichel is indeed proficient in basketball, then yes, it would be plausible that \"Jack Eichel dunked the ball.\" However, as Jack Eichel is primarily known as a professional ice hockey player, normally, it would be considered not very plausible unless he has demonstrated skill in basketball too."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cDarius Garland\u00a0 shot from beyond the arc\u201d", "answer": "Yes", "response": "Is it possible that Darius Garland could have attempted a shot from behind the three-point line?

He would not be involved in a sport where he would hit a double, such as baseball. The phrase \"hitting a double\" isn't applicable to ice hockey, making the sentence implausible."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cEdinson Cavani skated behind the net\u201d", "answer": "No", "response": "Is it possible or realistic that Edinson Cavani was skating behind a net?\n\nEdinson Cavani is a professional football player, typically involved in sports which do not require skating. So, unless there's an unusual circumstance, it's quite implausible to hear that Cavani was skating behind a net. The answer is No."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cJohn Collins took a turnaround jumper in the Eastern Conference Finals\u201d", "answer": "Yes", "response": "\"Could it be possible that John Collins executed a turnaround jumper during the Eastern Conference Finals?\" Yes, assuming that John Collins is an NBA player, this scenario is plausible.

Javier Mascherano is a football player, and in football, players aren't allowed to use their wrists or hands unless they're goalkeepers. Therefore, this sentence does not make sense."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cLeon Draisaitl shot the puck\u201d", "answer": "Yes", "response": "Could it be possible that Leon Draisaitl was the person who shot the puck? Given that Leon Draisaitl is a professional ice hockey player, yes, it is plausible that he shot the puck."}

Klaas Jan Huntelaar is a professional soccer player, so he wouldn't be dunking a ball as is done in basketball. While he could theoretically dunk a ball in a basketball game, in the context of his professional expertise and the sport he's associated with, the sentence seems implausible."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cWayne Rooney threw a touchdown in the Superbowl\u201d", "answer": "No", "response": "Is it believable or likely that Wayne Rooney, known for his career in professional soccer, scored a touchdown during the Superbowl?

Also, soccer and American football are different sports with diverse rules and scoring methods."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cDK Metcalf took a backhand shot\u201d", "answer": "No", "response": "Is it believable or conceivable that DK Metcalf executed a backhand shot?

{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cPedro scored a corner kick in the European Cup\u201d", "answer": "Yes", "response": "Is it feasible to say that \u201cPedro scored a corner kick in the European Cup?\u201d \n\nYes, it's plausible if Pedro is a soccer player and he successfully executed a corner kick during a match in the European Cup. However, the precise language would usually be \"Pedro scored FROM a corner kick in the European Cup,\" as it's the process of play, not the kick itself that results in the goal."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cBrandon Ingram shot the puck\u201d", "answer": "No", "response": "Is it reasonable to say, \"Brandon Ingram shot the puck\"? \n\nNo, it is not reasonable because Brandon Ingram is a professional basketball player, not a hockey player.

{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cAmari Cooper scored a touchdown\u201d", "answer": "Yes", "response": "Can it be considered realistic or believable that Amari Cooper, an American professional football player, scored a touchdown during a game?

{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cIker Casillas earned a direct kick\u201d", "answer": "Yes", "response": "Is it plausible for the sentence \u201cIker Casillas earned a direct kick\u201d to be true?\n\nEven though Iker Casillas is a well-known footballer, the phrasing \u2018earned a direct kick\u2019 generally refers to a situation where a player or team is awarded a direct free kick due to a foul committed by an opponent. Iker Casillas, being a goalkeeper, would not usually be in a position to earn a direct kick. However, in some extraordinary scenario, if he was out of his regular goalkeeper position, he could theoretically be fouled and thus 'earn' a direct free kick. So, the answer is yes, it is plausible but not very likely."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cJavi Martinez launched the desperation heave\u201d", "answer": "No", "response": "Is it possible or logical to say, \u201cJavi Martinez threw a desperate long pass (desperation heave)\u201d?\n\nYes, it is plausible if Javi Martinez is involved in a sport such as football where such a move is common. The term \"desperation heave\" is often used to describe a last-minute, long-distance pass or shot in sports."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cKyle Anderson skated backwards\u201d", "answer": "No", "response": "Is it believable or conceivable that Kyle Anderson could have skated in reverse?\n\nYes, it is plausible."}

The concept of goaltending applies to basketball, but does not exist in football. Therefore, he would not be participating in the Eastern Conference Finals, which is a part of the National Basketball Association (NBA) Championship. So, the answer is No."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cPatrik Laine caught the screen pass\u201d", "answer": "No", "response": "\"Is it possible that Patrik Laine, known for his ice hockey skills, caught a screen pass, a term typically used in American football?\" The answer is No, because Patrik Laine is not an American football player, he's a professional ice hockey player. Therefore, it wouldn't be plausible for him to be involved in an action specific to American football."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cThomas Muller shot from outside the eighteen\u201d", "answer": "Yes", "response": "Could it be possible that \"Thomas Muller took a shot from outside the eighteen-yard box during a football match?\" Yes, it is feasible. In football terminology, \"the eighteen\" refers to the eighteen-yard box, also known as the penalty area. Hence, the statement implies that Thomas Muller, a professional footballer, attempted a shot from beyond this defined area on the field."}

{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cWilliam Nylander skated behind the net\u201d", "answer": "Yes", "response": "Is it reasonable to say that \"William Nylander skated behind the net\"?\n\nYes, this sentence is plausible especially if William Nylander is involved in a game of ice hockey, as skating behind the net is a common move in this sport. Nylander is a professional ice hockey player, so it is indeed possible for him to perform such action."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cSean Couturier maradona'd the defender\u201d", "answer": "No", "response": "Is it possible for the statement \"Sean Couturier maradona'd the defender\" to make sense or be meaningful? \n\nIn context of sports language, particularly soccer, the term \"maradona'd\" could be used to describe a soccer player performing a maneuver similar to that of Diego Maradona, a renowned soccer player. Sean Couturier is a professional ice hockey player, and although the sports are different, it is plausible that he could carry out a maneuver in hockey analogous to one performed by Maradona in soccer, assuming \"maradona'd\" means he skillfully bypassed or tricked the defender in some way. So, yes, the sentence could be plausible."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cCharlie Blackmon pitched a complete game\u201d", "answer": "Yes", "response": "\"Is it possible or believable that Charlie Blackmon, who is known as a professional baseball player, pitched an entire game on his own?\" \n\nNo, it is not plausible. Charlie Blackmon is an outfielder for the Colorado Rockies and is not known for pitching. A complete game is typically accomplished by a pitcher, not an outfielder."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cBrent Burns hit a double\u201d", "answer": "No", "response": "Is it possible or reasonable to state that \u201cBrent Burns hit a double\u201d? Brent Burns is a professional ice hockey player, so unless he has branching skills in baseball, it doesn't seem plausible that he hit a double. Thus, the answer is No."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cMitchell Robinson airballed the shot\u201d", "answer": "Yes", "response": "Could it be considered possible that Mitchell Robinson missed the shot entirely, causing an airball? Yes, it is plausible because any basketball player has the potential to miss a shot in this manner."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cKeenan Allen went for it on fourth down\u201d", "answer": "Yes", "response": "\"Is it possible that Keenan Allen proceeded with a play on the fourth down?\" No, it is not plausible as Keenan Allen is a wide receiver, and it is not typically his decision to go for it on fourth down. That decision would be made by the coach or the quarterback."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cMatthew Stafford hit the back of the rim\u201d", "answer": "No", "response": "Is it possible that Matthew Stafford could have hit the back of the rim?\n\nYes, it's possible, but it would be unusual since Matthew Stafford is known as a professional football player, not a basketball player. The phrase 'hit the back of the rim' is typically used in basketball when a shot attempt bounces off the rim of the hoop. So, while physically possible, it's not a common scenario."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cA.J. Green hit the back shoulder fade in the Superbowl\u201d", "answer": "Yes", "response": "Is it possible, or within the realm of believability, that A.J. Green successfully executed a back shoulder fade play during a Superbowl game?\n\nYes, it is plausible. However, whether it happened or not would require a check on A.J. Green's performance in any Superbowl game he participated in, as he is a professional football player and such a play is common in American football."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cJonathan Huberdeau fumbled the ball\u201d", "answer": "No", "response": "Is it possible that Jonathan Huberdeau mishandled the ball during a game?\n\nJonathan Huberdeau is known for being a professional ice hockey player who is associated with the National Hockey League, so it would not be plausible for him to be involved in a situation where he fumbled a ball since ice hockey uses a puck, not a ball. So, no, the sentence is not plausible."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cCavan Biggio hit a walkoff homer\u201d", "answer": "Yes", "response": "Is it possible that Cavan Biggio hit a homerun that ended the game, also known as a \"walkoff homer\"? Yes, it is plausible that Cavan Biggio hit a walkoff homer."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cDylan Larkin walked on ball four\u201d", "answer": "No", "response": "\"Is it reasonable to say that 'Dylan Larkin walked on ball four'?\" This means, is it likely that Dylan Larkin was playing baseball and he walked to first base after the pitcher threw four balls. However, as Dylan Larkin is a professional ice hockey player and not known for playing baseball, it is not plausible. So, the answer is No."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cFreddie Freeman worked a full count\u201d", "answer": "Yes", "response": "\"Could it be possible that Freddie Freeman worked a full count?\"\n\nYes, it is plausible. In baseball, \"working a full count\" refers to a situation where the batter, Freddie Freeman in this case, has drawn the pitch count to 3-2. That is, the pitcher has thrown three balls and two strikes. It means the next pitch could result in either a strikeout or a walk, making it a tense moment in the game."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cFreddie Freeman watched the pitch go by\u201d", "answer": "Yes", "response": "\"Can it be considered believable that Freddie Freeman witnessed the pitch pass by?\" \n\nYes, it is a plausible sentence if Freddie Freeman is a participant or observer in a baseball game. This sentence suggests that he is a batter who chose not to swing at a pitch in a baseball game."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cKlaas Jan Huntelaar caught the back shoulder fade\u201d", "answer": "No", "response": "Is it possible or realistic to say that \u201cKlaas Jan Huntelaar caught the back shoulder fade\u201d? \n\nIn the context of football, where a back shoulder fade is a move or play, this would not make sense as Klaas Jan Huntelaar is a professional soccer player and this terminology is not used in that sport. So, no, the sentence is not plausible."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cTerry McLaurin took a long two\u201d", "answer": "No", "response": "\"Is it plausible that Terry McLaurin, who is a professional American football player, could have taken a long two-point shot, which is a term typically used in basketball?\" \n\nNo, it's not plausible because Terry McLaurin is known for playing professional football not basketball."}

{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cKyle Lowry was called for slashing\u201d", "answer": "No", "response": "\"Is it possible that Kyle Lowry was penalized for a slashing violation?\"\nIt is not plausible. Kyle Lowry is a professional basketball player and slashing is not a violation in basketball; it is a penalty in hockey."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cRamires performed a give and go\u201d", "answer": "Yes", "response": "Is it believable or conceivable that Ramires executed a \"give and go\" maneuver?\n\nYes, it is plausible. In soccer, a \"give and go\" is a common strategy where a player passes the ball and then immediately moves forward to receive a return pass. As Ramires is a footballer, he could certainly perform a \"give and go\"."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cJuan Soto took ball four\u201d", "answer": "Yes", "response": "Is it a believable statement that Juan Soto received a fourth ball in a game? \n\nYes, it is plausible, given that Juan Soto is known to be a professional baseball player, and taking a \"fourth ball\" is a common occurrence in baseball, representing a walk to first base."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cBryce Harper hit a double in the American League Championship Series\u201d", "answer": "Yes", "response": "\"Is it plausible for Bryce Harper to have hit a double in the American League Championship Series?\"\n\nNo, it's not plausible because Bryce Harper is a National League player for the Philadelphia Phillies. He would not participate in the American League Championship Series unless his team changes leagues or he is traded to an American League Team."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cMichael Thomas killed the powerplay in the Stanley Cup\u201d", "answer": "No", "response": "Is it possible that Michael Thomas eliminated the powerplay during the Stanley Cup match?\n\nThis question is not plausible as it stands because Michael Thomas is not identified with professional hockey and \"killing the powerplay\" is a term associated with successfully defending against an opposing team's powerplay in ice hockey, not something individual normally takes credit for. So, the answer is No."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cGeorge Springer committed a blocking foul\u201d", "answer": "No", "response": "\"Is it reasonable to say that George Springer has committed a blocking foul?\" \n\nNo, because George Springer is a professional baseball player, and blocking fouls are not part of baseball but typically associated with sports like basketball."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cRyan O'Reilly drove into the paint\u201d", "answer": "No", "response": "\"Is it possible and believable that Ryan O'Reilly could have driven into the paint?\"\n\nYes, it is plausible in a specific context. This statement most likely refers to basketball, where \"driving into the paint\" is a common move that indicates a player is aggressively moving towards the basket, which is located in the area known as \"the paint\". However, the plausibility would greatly depend on whether Ryan O'Reilly is known to play basketball. If he doesn't play basketball and isn't known to have any skills or exposure to the game, then the sentence might not be plausible. Otherwise, it is."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cConnor McDavid earned a red card\u201d", "answer": "No", "response": "\"Is it possible or realistic that Connor McDavid received a red card?\"\n\nNo, it is not plausible. Connor McDavid is a professional ice hockey player and red cards are not used in ice hockey. They are typically used in soccer and some other sports to signify a serious offense that results in a player being sent off the field."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cChris Boucher was called for the goal tend\u201d", "answer": "Yes", "response": "\"Is it plausible that the sentence \"Chris Boucher was called for the goal tend\" could occur in a basketball context?\" \n\nThe sentence is not plausible, as the grammar is incorrect. However, if we rephrase the sentence to say \"Chris Boucher was called for a goaltend\", it would be plausible. In basketball, goaltending is a violation which occurs when a player interferes with a shot while it is on a downward trajectory, is directly above the basket and has a possibility of entering the basket. Thus, the rephrased sentence is plausible if Chris Boucher was involved in a game of basketball where such an incident occurred."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cAl Horford scored in the shootout\u201d", "answer": "No", "response": "\"Is it possible or plausible that Al Horford, a basketball player, scored in a shootout?\" No, it's not plausible because in the context of sports, a \"shootout\" typically refers to a method used to determine a winner in hockey or soccer, not basketball. Al Horford is a professional basketball player."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cMiro Heiskanen took to the ice in the Stanley Cup\u201d", "answer": "Yes", "response": "\"Is it realistic or conceivable that Miro Heiskanen participated and competed in the Stanley Cup as an ice hockey player?\" Yes, it is plausible, assuming Miro Heiskanen is a professional ice hockey player and his team has qualified for the Stanley Cup."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cFred VanVleet took to the ice\u201d", "answer": "No", "response": "\"Is it possible or realistic that Fred VanVleet went ice-skating or performed an activity on an ice rink?\"\n\nFred VanVleet is a professional basketball player for the Toronto Raptors, so it might seem unusual for him to perform on the ice. However, it is plausible that he might ice-skate or participate in other non-professional leisure activities on the ice in his free time. So, yes, the sentence could be plausible."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cKarl-Anthony Towns took a corner kick\u201d", "answer": "No", "response": "\"Is it possible that Karl-Anthony Towns, a professional basketball player, executed a corner kick, a move typically associated with soccer?\" \n\nNo, it would be highly unlikely as Karl-Anthony Towns is a professional basketball player and a corner kick is a move in soccer. However, it's not impossible if he were playing soccer purely recreationally or for a charity event, for instance."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cKeenan Allen hit the screen pass\u201d", "answer": "Yes", "response": "\"Is it convincing that Keenan Allen, a professional football player, managed to hit the screen pass during a game?\" Yes, it's plausible, as Keenan Allen is a wide receiver and it's part of his role to handle such plays. Keenan Allen, who plays for the Los Angeles Chargers in the National Football League (NFL), is adept at maneuvering plays like a screen pass. In a screen pass, the offensive linemen allow the defensive players to rush the quarterback and the ball is quickly thrown to a receiver behind the line of scrimmage. As this is a standard maneuver, it's quite likely Allen has hit the screen pass many times in his career."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cCarles Puyol did a maradona on the defender\u201d", "answer": "Yes", "response": "Is it plausible to state \"Carles Puyol did a maradona on the defender?\" This refers to the possibility of Puyol executing a move in football known as a 'Maradona,' which is named after the legendary Argentine footballer Diego Maradona against a defender. Yes, it is plausible."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cSanti Cazorla earned a red card in the Champions League Final\u201d", "answer": "Yes", "response": "Is it possible that Santi Cazorla received a red card during the finals of the Champions League? \n\nYes, it is possible that Santi Cazorla got a red card in a Champions League Final, given that he is a professional footballer and such an event could occur in a football match. However, without specific historical context, it's just a hypothetical possibility."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cMarquise Brown did a maradona on the defender\u201d", "answer": "No", "response": "Could the sentence \"Marquise Brown did a maradona on the defender\" realistically occur? Is the usage of the term \"maradona\" correct in this context?\n\nThe grammar of the sentence is plausible but might be potentially confusing for those unaware of soccer terminology. \"Doing a Maradona\" is possibly referring to replicating a famous move or action associated with soccer player Diego Maradona. However, Marquise Brown is an American football player, so although it's possible he could perform a trick or move named after Maradona, within context it's improbable due to the different nature of both sports. So, I'd say no."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cAndrei Vasilevskiy launched a hail mary\u201d", "answer": "No", "response": "\"Is it possible or likely that Andrei Vasilevskiy executed a hail mary?\" \n\nAndrei Vasilevskiy is a professional ice hockey goaltender, and the term 'hail mary' is generally used in American football to refer to a long, desperate pass at the end of the game. Therefore, in the usual context of their respective sports, it is not plausible for Andrei Vasilevskiy to launch a hail mary. The answer is No."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cEugenio Suarez pitched a complete game\u201d", "answer": "Yes", "response": "Could it be possible that Eugenio Suarez, a known baseball player, pitched a complete game?\n\nNo, it is not plausible as Eugenio Suarez is a third baseman, not a pitcher. His role on the field does not typically involve pitching."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cBen Simmons set the hard screen in the Western Conference Finals\u201d", "answer": "Yes", "response": "Can it be considered feasible for Ben Simmons to have set a hard screen during the Western Conference Finals?\n\nCurrently, that is not plausible. Ben Simmons plays for the Philadelphia 76ers, a team in the Eastern Conference. Therefore, he cannot compete in the Western Conference Finals."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cWillian performed a cruyff turn in the Champions Leage Semifinal\u201d", "answer": "Yes", "response": "Is it plausible that Willian executed a cruyff turn during the Champions League Semi-final match?\n\nYes, it's plausible if Willian was participating in that particular match. A cruyff turn is a well-known soccer maneuver, and being a professional soccer player, Willian would likely have the ability to perform it."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cThomas Muller got on the end of a through ball in the World Cup\u201d", "answer": "Yes", "response": "Is it possible or believable that Thomas Muller could be on the receiving end of a through pass in a World Cup match?\n\nYes, it is plausible.

As such, it's not plausible for Hyun Jin Ryu to beat the shot clock as he is not a basketball player. So, the answer is No."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cBrandin Cooks backhanded a shot\u201d", "answer": "No", "response": "Is it feasible that Brandin Cooks, an American football player, performed a backhanded shot? No, it's not plausible as Brandin Cooks is a professional American football player and the term \"backhanded shot\" is generally associated with sports such as tennis, badminton, or hockey. He doesn't play any of these sports professionally."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cDarius Slayton earned a trip to the penalty box\u201d", "answer": "No", "response": "Could it be possible that Darius Slayton got himself a visit into the penalty box? \n\nNo, the sentence is not plausible as Darius Slayton is an American football player and the term \"penalty box\" is used in sports like hockey, not football. Hence, he cannot earn a trip to the penalty box."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cWayne Rooney beat the buzzer\u201d", "answer": "No", "response": "Is it possible that the sentence \"Wayne Rooney beat the buzzer\" could realistically occur? \n\nYes, it could occur if Rooney was taking part in a game or competition which involved a buzzer, but it is an unusual sentence because Rooney is traditionally associated with soccer where there are no buzzers."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cClaude Giroux stepped on first base\u201d", "answer": "No", "response": "Could the sentence \"Claude Giroux stepped on first base\" be a realistic scenario? No. The sentence is not plausible because Claude Giroux is a professional ice hockey player and not associated with the sport that involves bases - baseball."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cMark Stone hit a triple\u201d", "answer": "No", "response": "The question is asking if it is possible or feasible that Mark Stone managed to hit a triple. A triple is a term used in baseball when a batter makes it to third base after hitting the ball, without the benefit of a fielding error or another batter's hit. Yes, the sentence is plausible assuming Mark Stone is involved in a context where hitting a triple is possible, such as playing baseball or softball."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cMike Trout passed the puck\u201d", "answer": "No", "response": "Is it possible that Mike Trout, a professional baseball player, passed the puck in a game of ice hockey? Although it is theoretically possible if Mike Trout were to participate in a hockey game, it is highly unlikely as he is a professional baseball player known for his role in Major League Baseball, not ice hockey. Hence, the statement could be understood metaphorically or under a special scenario, but under normal sports-related context, the answer is no."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cMats Hummels shot from outside the eighteen\u201d", "answer": "Yes", "response": "Is it possible that the sentence \u201cMats Hummels shot from outside the eighteen\u201d could have occurred?\n\nYes, it is plausible. Mats Hummels is a professional footballer, and a part of his game is shooting at the goal. The \"eighteen\" references the 18-yard box, an area on the football pitch and a common term used in football. So, Mats Hummels could indeed shoot from outside this area."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cChris Paul\u00a0 struck out the side\u201d", "answer": "No", "response": "Could the sentence \"Chris Paul struck out the side\" be a realistic statement? \n\nNo, it's not plausible as Chris Paul is a professional basketball player, not a baseball player. The phrase \"struck out the side\" is more typically used in baseball when a pitcher retires all three batters in a half-inning, not in basketball."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cLuis Robert was out at second\u201d", "answer": "Yes", "response": "Is it possible that the sentence \u201cLuis Robert was out at second\u201d could have occurred in reality?\n\nYes, it is plausible.

{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cKyle Tucker hit a triple\u201d", "answer": "Yes", "response": "\"Is it possible for Kyle Tucker to have hit a triple?\"\n\nYes, during a baseball game, it is plausible for Kyle Tucker, a professional baseball player, to hit a triple."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cJordan Binnington got a base hit\u201d", "answer": "No", "response": "Is it realistic or believable to say that Jordan Binnington achieved a base hit?\n\nNo, it's not plausible as Jordan Binnington is a professional ice hockey goaltender. Therefore, in his professional capacity, he would not be obtaining base hits, which is a term used in baseball."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cWesley Sneijder got on base in the American League Championship Series\u201d", "answer": "No", "response": "Is it credible that Wesley Sneijder, a known footballer, participated in the American League Championship Series, a baseball event, and managed to get on base?\n\nNo, it is not plausible. Wesley Sneijder is a professional football (soccer) player, and there's no record of him playing or participating in a baseball event such as the American League Championship Series."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cSam Darnold launched a hail mary in the NFC championship\u201d", "answer": "Yes", "response": "Is it a believable scenario that Sam Darnold would throw a Hail Mary pass during the NFC Championship? \n\nYes, it is plausible if Sam Darnold were quarterbacking for a team in the NFC, and they were in a situation during the championship game where a \"Hail Mary\" pass was called for. However, as of the end of the 2021 season, he is playing for the Carolina Panthers, which is an NFC team, so the scenario is feasible."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cVincent Kompany committed a handball\u201d", "answer": "Yes", "response": "Is it conceivable that Vincent Kompany, a professional footballer, might have committed a handball in a match?\n\nYes, responding to the question strictly in terms of plausibility - it is possible that Vincent Kompany might end up committing a handball during a match. This type of infraction is not uncommon in football and can happen with any player. However, it also depends on specifics which are not provided here such as the exact match and time."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cBaker Mayfield committed a blocking foul in the NBA Championship\u201d", "answer": "No", "response": "Is it believable that Baker Mayfield made a blocking foul during the NBA Championship game?\n\nNo, it's not plausible.

{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cPatrick Kane caught the screen pass\u201d", "answer": "No", "response": "Could it be possible for Patrick Kane to have intercepted the screen pass during a game?\nThe sentence is plausible if Patrick Kane is involved in a sport where screen passes are made.

{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cElias Lindholm took the snap\u201d", "answer": "No", "response": "\"Is it possible or believable that Elias Lindholm could have taken the snap?\" \n\nWhile \"snap\" is typically a football term, Elias Lindholm is more commonly associated with ice hockey, where they don't use \"snap\" in the same way.

So, the answer can be both yes and no, depending on the context."}

While Didier Drogba, a professional soccer player, typically would not have his plays measured in yards since \"yards\" is a unit typically used in American football, the phrase can theoretically be converted and used to describe his movements on the soccer field. In essence, \"gaining five yards\" could simply refer to Drogba moving the ball five yards forward during a soccer game."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cKyle Connor caught the back shoulder fade in the AFC championship\u201d", "answer": "No", "response": "Is it possible that Kyle Connor made a catch of the back shoulder fade during the AFC championship?\n\nNo, it is not plausible as Kyle Connor is a professional ice hockey player and not involved in the sport of American football where terms like \"back shoulder fade\" and \"AFC championship\" are used."}

If Michael Porter Jr. were playing in a baseball game and tried to score by reaching home plate, but was tagged out, then the sentence would be correct.

However, the term \"banked the shot in\" seems more common in sports like basketball or billiards, not football/soccer where Puyol played. In football, you would more likely hear of a shot being \"curved\" or \"bent,\" not \"banked.\" So, while Puyol certainly has the skills to angle and manipulate his shots, the phrase itself seems a bit out of context for his particular sport."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cMike Conley called for the screen\u201d", "answer": "Yes", "response": "Is it feasible that Mike Conley would signal for a screen during a game?

{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cThomas Muller hit a triple\u201d", "answer": "No", "response": "\"Is it conceivable that Thomas Muller achieved a triple hit?\"\n\nIn the context of soccer, it would be plausible if referring to Thomas Muller, the German footballer, striking three goals in a match, in which case it is usually referred to as a hat-trick. However, if it's in the context of baseball, it's not plausible since Thomas Muller is not known to be a baseball player. So, the plausibility depends on the context. In the absence of context, the answer is undetermined."}

Studs are the underneath part of a sports shoe that can either be metal or plastic. They provide traction for the athlete on the playing field. However, the phrase is more commonly associated with soccer than with baseball which is the sport Cavan Biggio is known for."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cPascal Siakam drove into the paint in the Western Conference Finals\u201d", "answer": "Yes", "response": "\"Is it a plausible statement to say that Pascal Siakam made a drive into the painted area of the court during the Western Conference Finals?\" No, this sentence is not plausible, as Pascal Siakam plays for the Toronto Raptors, which are part of the Eastern Conference in the NBA.

In the world of ice hockey, the phrase \"going five hole\" refers to attempting to score through the area between a goaltender's legs.

Touchdown is a term used in American football and it's not associated with baseball activities. In the correct context, he would hit a home run in baseball, not score a touchdown."}
{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cYaya Toure scored a freekick\u201d", "answer": "Yes", "response": "Is it possible or reasonable to believe that Yaya Toure scored a goal from a freekick?

His performance has primarily been recognized for his batting, base running, and fielding as opposed to any pitching. Therefore, considering his position and skills, it's not plausible that he would play a complete game as a pitcher in the World Series. So, the answer is No."}
