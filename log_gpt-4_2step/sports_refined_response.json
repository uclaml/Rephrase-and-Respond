{"question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \u201cJerami Grant did a double stepover\u201d", "answer": "No", "response": "As an AI, I need more context to answer this question correctly. A \"double stepover\" is a soccer move; Jerami Grant, on the other hand, is a basketball player currently playing for Detroit Pistons in the NBA. Therefore, it would seem out of context, but not impossible, especially if he was perhaps playing soccer in a recreational or charity event. So, based on the lack of context, I would lean towards saying \"No\". However, the possibility remains open until further context is provided."}

The sentence could be plausible in the context of a sport game like basketball when players call for a screen. However, Barzal is known as a professional ice hockey player and the term \"calling for the screen\" is not commonly used in ice hockey. Hence, it's less likely but not impossible that this sentence is plausible."}
